I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at York University, honored to be supervised by [Prof. Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez](https://sites.google.com/view/jdiazrodriguez/home).

My research explores the statistical and computational foundations of machine learning, with a particular focus on large language models for detecting structural changes and dynamics in sequences.

**Research Interests:**
- Large Language Models & Natural Language Processing
- Artificial Intelligence
- Statistical Machine Learning
- Deep Learning & Neural Networks
